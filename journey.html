                    <h2>What is ADA?</h2>
                <p>ADA, named after Ada Lovelace (the first female coder), is a non-profit programme which aims to educate young women of colour to become Front-End Developers and join the tech industry. ADA provides an immersive, mentored, fully-funded web development education to young, African, women.</p>
                <p>ADA's mission is to empower. They give young, African women the tools and confidence to become successful game-changers in the field of technology by providing them with immersive, mentored, fully-funded Front-End Development education.</p>

                    <h2>How I started</h2>
                 <p>The African Developers Academy had limited capacity in its first ever year, and so had to be rigorous in their testing and eventual selection of the student body of 2019/2020. This meant that students had to apply first through Harambe, where they completed a series of aptitude tests to make sure that they had what it takes to be a web developer</p>
                 <p>There were 500 applications, 100 selected candidates through Harambe and only 12 spots. This means that only 2% of applicants would make it through.</p>
                 <p>
                  All of the 100 selected candidates were invited to take part in challenges hosted by ADA which put them to the test - checking for resilience, strength of character, attitude and of course ability. The women who made it through proved themselves in many ways, and continued to do so throughout their studies.</p>

                    <h2>My Cooding Journey</h2>
            <p>Being an ADA graduate is one of the best things to have happened to me. I got to meet amazing women who are as dedicated as I am and have a lot to achieve. It was not a simple journey but we all know that there’s no simple route to success, especially the one to a greater future. We were all willing to learn new things everyday and we were all dedicated and gave it all our best in every way. </p>
           <p>
            I enjoyed myself a lot throughout the whole program. I had many opportunities to learn and see new things. I didn't know anything about coding when we started but now I know more than I thought I would. I had to accept challenges and work with others. It is almost surreal to reflect on the year that went by at ADA, it was all so quick and perhaps that’s my favourite thing - being in a fast paced environment where you are put to the test on a daily basis. There's many things to learn and I learnt as much as I could in the time that I had. I'm grateful for it all because I got to discover so many things.
            </p>
           <p>At the start of 2020, I had bright hopes for the year ahead, but little did I know that much of this was soon to change. The CoronaVirus was discovered and took the world by storm. This meant that for months we were not able to go to class and many companies closed, we - the ADA students -  were unable to complete our promised internships and we came back to school with one month left to finish our studies. Despite this setback, I am still as determined as ever to continue my journey as a coder, designer and developer. Not the CoronaVirus, not anything, is going to stop me.</p>  
           <p>It’s been a long, windy and wonderful journey. I learned many things, I experienced a lot, I made new friends throughout the process and I'm glad that I got the opportunity to experience it all. </p>
